# PropertyTypeCategorization

### Dated:
Boston University, Spring 2023

### Description:
**DATASET:**
The dataset used for this project has been prepared by scraping information off of makaan.com's website. The analysis of this project will be based on determining the type of property based on its features and characteristics. To avoid data imbalance, the categorization is done as “Apartments” and “Non-Apartments”. By addressing this, the aim is to enhance the search engine of the Makaan.com website, providing more tailored search results that are in line with customers' preferences and requirements. The dataset in the drive can be extracted from the uploaded zip file. It is named: “Makaan_Properties_Buy.csv”
We have accessed this dataset as “df” in our project. 


**CODE FILE:**
We have used R Programming Language for our project. It can be accessed in the Drive. It has been named “Maheshwari_Aditya_Shah_Vaidehi_CS699 Final Project.R”. This project will implement the following:

Five binary classification algorithms:
1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors
3. Naïve Bayesian
4. Random Forest
5. Support Vector Machines

Five attribute selection methods:
1. Chi-Square Test
2. Boruta Model
3. r-part
4. random forest feature importance
5. Recursive Feature Elimination


### Achievements:
● Streamlined data analysis workflow, reducing feature dimensionality by 40% through effective feature selection methods leading to a 12% improvement in model accuracy as compared to initial dataset 

● Developed and evaluated 30 ML models using 5 classification algorithms and 5 Feature Selection Methods to achieve an average accuracy of 88.16%, with Random Forest model outperforming other models across multiple attribute selection methods
